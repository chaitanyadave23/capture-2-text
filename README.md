# capture-2-text
Machine Learning project to recognize text from a distorted image using Deep Convolutional Neural Network.

Instructions to run the project 
----------------------------------------
1. Run the ocr_data_gen.ipynb file which will generates distorted images which is in turn used as a data set to train the model. 
2. Run the ocr_train.ipynb file for training the model 
3. Run the ocr_result.ipynb file to generate the result
